## 0. Introduction

---

The Ballet API stores information of the ballet companies and the dancers belonging to them (no private information accepted).
The motivation of creating this is to hope to visualize gender and nationality equality in the ballet scene (if I can keep implementing this).

Currently this API is at the experimental stage.
